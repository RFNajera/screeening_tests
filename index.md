Most of the tests done in medical offices or small clinics are called "screening tets." This is because they screen the patient for a disease or condition in order to aid in the diagnosis. (You can find a [list of approved screening tests in the United States here](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/CLIA/downloads/waivetbl.pdf).) More advanced laboratory tests are called ["diagnostic tests,"](https://medlineplus.gov/diagnostictests.html) and they're very definitive in diagnosing a disease or condition. Diagnostic tests are generally more invasive or complicated (and expensive).

Before you have any kind of testing done, your healthcare provider will ask several questions. Those questions are meant to...

In this exercise, we will learn to create a Shiny Dashboard in R that uses only the data the user inputs. There are some calculations involved in the output that goes into the two graphs, but they're not very complicated once you understand the math behind it. This app can then be used to help public health students understand the relationship between disease prevalence and the reliability of screening tests.
